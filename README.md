# Wasserstein Probability Flows
Code accompanying the paper:

***Nonstationary Distribution Estimation via Wasserstein Probability Flows***

Authors: Edward Anderson, Dominic Keehan

## Description
......

## Dependencies
You must install a recent version of Julia from http://julialang.org/downloads/. The paper uses Julia 1.9.

A number of Julia packages are required. They can be added by commanding:

`using Pkg, Pkg.add("JuMP, ......")`.*

*Note that a license for the COPT solver is also required; see https://www.shanshu.ai/copt. The paper uses COPT XXXX.X. Alternatively, with appropriate tweaks to the code, Ipopt can be used (in this case it is likely any figures generated will differ slightly from those in the paper).

## Reproducing Output from the Paper
You can reproduce Figure XXXX by running the script ".......jl".
